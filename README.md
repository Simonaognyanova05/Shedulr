# To Do App
This is a web application that aims to help users plan their day. Each user can create a task, as well as mark it as completed, register and log in to their profile. Tasks are visible only to the user who created them. The task contains the creation date, title, description and deadline for completion.

In development:
- Adding the ability to edit each task.
- Adding a weekly schedule page that the user can create and edit.
